# CoffeeWithDevs

## About Us

CoffeeWithDevs is an open-source, non-profit and charitable organisation supporting developers who intend to work on real-world projects rather than making To-Do apps. We let them learn new skills and explore creative ideas by assigning them to various projects of their fitting technologies.

Visit CoffeeWithDevs Site [here](https://coffeewithdevs.github.io/).

## How We Work?

We invite people to come on GitHub, the world's largest open-source community of developers. We create different projects on various technologies and assign them to developers who propose to take that project.
